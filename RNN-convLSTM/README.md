### convlstm for video prediction
We modified the [ConvLSTM library](https://github.com/viorik/ConvLSTM) provided by viorik. This *main.lua* takes computed spatial and temporal feature vectors from severla equally sampled video frames, and learns a expanded LSTM model to represent the videos aross all training video frames.

Using command line arguments or modify the code in *main.lua*, you can essentially modify the Learning rate, batch size, CUDA options, dropout layers, and the dimension of hidden layers.
